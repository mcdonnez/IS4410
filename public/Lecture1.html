	<p>Great predictions on what would happen 30 years in the future. This is the first time that the term "Information Technology" (IT) appeared and spawned an entire industry.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>What they got wrong:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Middle management would move down to the lower levels</li>
		<li>Upper Management would have more of a barrier</li>
		<li>The regular of employee won't be able to have a creative worklife</li>
		<li>Technology would replace people in decision making.</li>
		<li>Depersonalization between upper and middle management. Upper management will come from specific schools instead of middle management.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>What they got right:</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Upper management would be freed up to be more creative.</li>
		<li>New field would be a combination of hard science (computers) and soft science (social sciences).</li>
		<li>Information technology would rapidly spread</li>
		<li>IT will extend the thinking of individuals (kind of true, no AI but a lot of tools available)</li>
		<li>IT promises fewer people to do more work. (Adam Frisbee says that this will create many more jobs)</li>
		<li>Correctly predicted that business would only survive by being innovative (Google, Apple, etc).</li>
		<li>A computer will be a chess champion (Actually in 1997, they thought 1968 it would happen).</li>

	<p>Today we will be focusing on the hardware and software part of the 5 part model. CIO means Chief Information Officer and CTO means Cheif Technology Officer.</p>
	<h3>The layered view of computers and peoples</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>People</li>
		<li>Application - This is where people are interacting with the computer.</li>
		<li>System - A developer still lives at the top of this layer.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Higher Level Languages (Java, Ruby, C#)</li>
			<li>Machine Code (basically binary)</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Hardware</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>What is Binary?</h3>
	<h4>Binary is a numbers systems in the powers of 2.</h4>
	<p>To translate from binary to our traditional system with the power of 10. We can create a table. (See below). Here are some definitions. A 0 and 1 are a Bit and a Byte is 8 bits (generally) Fun fact: The number 0 came from the Arabs</p>
	<table id="binary">
		<tr>
			<th colspan="3">Here is the binary for 13</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>10 Powers:</td>
			<td>128</td>
			<td>64</td>
			<td>32</td>
			<td>16</td>
			<td>8</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>2</td>

	<p>If you add all of the numbers in the 10 powers row that have a 1 you will get the number. So for the example above you should add: 8 + 4 + 1 = 13</p>

	<h2>Lecture: History of Information Systems</h2>
	<input type="button" class="hideshow" value="Expand/Hide">
	<div>
	<p>The first person to come up with a computer was Charles Babbage, the father of the computer. He created blueprints for a machine to do calculations for this astronomy.</p>
	<h4>Moore's Law</h4>
	<p class="quote">The number of components we can place on a circuit will double every 18 months. <br>-Moore mid 1960s</p>
	<p>What most people interpret this phrase to mean is that the speed of processing will double every 18 months. Some have thought of this as a self fulfilling processing. This is because companies usually used Moore's law to plan their future development.</p>
	<h4>Alan Turing</h4>
	<p class="quote">I propose to consider the question "Can machines think?"<br> -Turing 1950</p>
	<p class="quote">"...once the machine thining method ahs started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stae therefore we should expect the machines to take control...<br>-Turing 1951</p>
	<p>Many of Turing's insights have fueled the discussion about the future of computers.</p>
	<h4>Charles Babbage, "The Father of the Computer"</h4>
	<p>Babbage Difference Engine Serial #2: This machine was never built in his lifetime. It was built by a musuem in the 1990s when blueprints of his machine were discovered. It was seven stacked up adding machines stacked on top of each other.</p>
	<h4>The Atanasoff-Berry Computer</h4>
	<p>First computer to use electricity as the energy source. Not many details are known how this machine worked. It's not very well known.</p>
	<h4>Harvard Mark I</h4>
	<p>Made all of the calculations necessary for atomic bombs. This was made for the Manhattan Project. It was great at calculating the blast radius for atomic bombs</p>
	<h4>Colossus</h4>
	<p>Accepted paper with holes in it to figure out how to crack the code. This is not the turin machine.</p>
	<h4>ENIAC</h4>
	<p>Developed by the United States at the end of WWII. It had a map of lines to set up a program. It took so long to setup a program that they would try to use that one program as much as possible. The output was a set of flashing lights.</p>
	<h4>1950s Era: UNIVAC</h4>
	<p>UNIVAC is the Universal Automatic Computer. First made in 1951 and successfully predicted the presidential prediction. Has many magnetic tapes to input information into the machine. There was still no kind of display or terminal that we are used to.</p>
	<h4>PDP-1</h4>
	<p>Has the first game ever called "Spaceware!"</p>
	<p>Nolan Bushnell is an alumni of University of Utah and is one of the fathers of Video Games. He developed his own version of Spacewar and then invented the original Pong machine (1970s). This is where he made all of his money.</p>
	<h4>Atari 2600: 1978</h4>
	<p>Nolan Bushnell also created the first game station called Atari. These old electronics are very nice quality because they weren't made over seas.</p>
	<h4>IBM System/360</h4>
	<p>This machine could be customized so that you didn't need to buy everything. This put IBM on the map.</p>
	<h4>Supercomputers</h4>
	<p>CDC 600 (1965) and the Cray-1 (1976)<br>The CDC was centered in a circle to make the wiring shorter and make the cooling system smaller and more efficient. The Cray-1 cost $1.5 Million dollars and had the tenth of the computing power of an Iphone6.</p>
	<h4>Rise of the MiniComputer</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>DEC PDP-8</li>
		<li>Data General Nova</li>
		<li>DEC PDP-11</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These computers fit on half of a desk instead of an entire room. The Data General Nova allowed the first MRI to run. The DEC PDP was one of the first computers on the internet. The University of Utah was one of the first 4 computers of the internet back in 1969. Also the founder of pixar is from UofU.</p>
	<h4>MicroComputer Revolution</h4>
	<p>These are the computers and laptops and we are using today. The ALTAIR 8800 (1975) was the first computer that became available with different programs. The Commodore 64 and the Apple IIe were in the picture as well. IBM stuck with corporate computing. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs stuck to software.</p>
	<h4>Modern Devices</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Apple iPad Air</li>
		<li>Microsoft Surface</li>
	</ul>
